Description: ==============
        GNOWSYS Studio
        ==============
        
        A collaborative workspace (studio) for constructing and publishing semantic
        knowledge networks and ontologies.  
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        The application is devided into two sub-apps.  Gstudio and
        Objectapp. The former includes classes for organizing the network or
        constructing an ontology.  The latter includes classes for holding the
        instances of object-types, process-types and system-types. 
        
        Gstudio Components
        ------------------
        
        * Metatypes
        
          To hold Classes which have other classes as its members. e.g. "abstract noun", "adjective", "phylem", "class", "genus", "species" etc.
        * Object types
        
          To hold Classes: e.g. "thing", "being", "living being", "animals", "cat", "place", "person" etc.
        * Relation types
          
        To define binary relations (object properties) between classes and objects.  e.g., "part of", "friend of", "composed of", "located in" etc.
        * Attribute types
          
          To define datatype properties for classes and objects. e.g., "population", "size", "length", "height", "first name", "phone number" etc.
        * System types 
          
          To bring together some of the classes into a system or
          an ontology, a collection of the types defined above for
          convenience. You can bring together the required classes, relations
          and attributes into 
        * Process types
        
          To define a process as prior and post states of classes or objects.
        * Attributes
        
          To store attributes
        * Relations
        
          To store binary relations
        * Node Specification
        
          A node specified (described) by its relations or attributes or both.  
        * Relation Specification
          
          To create an expression using a relation with a subject, e.g.,
          "friend of Tom", "components of a cell" etc.
        
        * Attribute Specification
        
            To specify an attribute by a subject to say for example:
            population of India, color of a flower etc.  These do not yeild a
            proposition but an expression, which can be used as a subject in
            another sentence.
        
        * Expression
          
          Expression is more like a relation between two terms, but it does not yeild a proposition, e.g., 
          "Researchers in  India", "students residing in India" etc.  It is modelled more like relation
          class, except that the result is not a proposition/triple.
        
        * Union
          
          To define a class by a union relation between two or more classes.
        
        * Complement
        
          To define a class as a compleemnt of two or more classes.
        
        * Intersection
        
          To define a class as an intersection between two or more classes.
        
        Objectapp Components
        ------------------
        
        * Objects
          
          To hold the instances of Object types: "Mumbai", "Tom" etc.
        
        * Systems
        
          To hold the instances of System types.  
        
        * Processes
        
          To hold the instances of processes.
